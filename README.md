## NoSQL-challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.



### For this challenge I did the following:

## Part 1 Database & Jupyter Notebook Setup

* Imported the data from establishments.json and setup the database and collection from the data that was imported.

## Part 2 Updating the database

* Used Mongo, PyMongo, Python, & Pandas to update the database
* Updated Business ID field
* Converted the latitude, longitude, and rating values types to decimal and integer respectively

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

* Used queries to find which establishments Hygiene scores were equal to 20.
* Used queries to find which establishments rating values scores were greater than or equal to 4.
* Used a query to find the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, & sorted it by lowest.
* Used a query to find how many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0.
* Sort the results from highest to lowest & printed the top ten local authority areas.
